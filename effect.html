The impact of excessive Testosterone

Having excessive natural testosterone is not a common problem among men. Most of what is known about the effects of excessive testosterone levels comes from studies conducted on those who use anabolic or artificial steroids to increase their testosterone levels.

High testosterone levels can cause some problems in men. These include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, increased risk of blood clotting, increased risk of heart attack, heart muscle damage, prostate enlargement and liver disease.

In addition, excessive testosterone can cause low sperm count, shrinking testes and even impotence. In women, excessive testosterone can cause many problems as well as decrease in breast size and deepening of the sound.

Low Impact of Testosterone

There are a number of problems associated with having too low testosterone levels. In men, problems may include loss of muscle mass, brittle bones (along with increased risk of fracture), irritability, poor concentration and depression.

In addition, men with low testosterone levels may suffer from low libido, reduced sperm count, infertility and impotence. In women, low testosterone can lead to lower bone strength, lower libido and depression.
